# Region map of `BOOT.BIN` `.text` (ULES01213)

`.text` runs from 0x08804000 to 0x0890DE38 (3572 functions found by splat), then
`.sceStub.text` (system call stubs) to 0x0890E6B8.

## Regions

| Range (approximate) | Code | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0x08804000 - ~0x08811C00 | not Metrowerks style (library code, hypothesis) | below |
| ~0x08811C00 - ~0x08904000 | Metrowerks `mwccpsp` (game and engine) | 6 probe functions match (`notes/COMPILER.md`) |
| ~0x08904000 - 0x0890DE38 | not Metrowerks style; holds the entry point 0x08906934 | below |

The edges are only known to a few functions: the first edge lies between
0x08811B3C and 0x08811C84, the second between 0x08903ED0 and 0x089040A0. A few
functions inside the middle region also have the outer style (0x08901FDC,
0x089030D8, 0x08903A94, 0x08903C64), so the edges may be ragged or the measures
noisy.

## Evidence

Three measures over the splat output, all pointing to the same two outer regions:

1. **Loading a global into `$v0`.** mwccpsp writes `lui $v0, %hi(sym)` then
   `lw $v0, %lo(sym)($v0)`. In the middle region all 380 such loads use `$v0` as the
   base. In the outer regions 12 use another register (`lui $v1` /
   `lw $v0, ($v1)`), from 0x08808764 to 0x0880C57C and from 0x08907254 to
   0x089073F8; 3 use `$v0` (0x0890C20C-0x0890C254, small getters near the end of
   `.text`, maybe another object).
2. **Prologue order.** In functions that open a stack frame, mwccpsp saves `$ra`
   first: 1981 of 2051 functions between 0x08820000 and 0x08900000. Between
   0x08804000 and 0x0880C600 it is 16 of 46, between 0x08904000 and 0x08907400 it is
   5 of 24.
3. **Allegrex instructions.** `movn`, `movz`, `ext`, `ins`, `min`, `max` are dense in
   0x08804000-0x08813000 and 0x08904000-0x0890C000, rare in between (use not identified;
   0x088E9B78-0x088EB01C has a small group).

Probes: the two functions mwccpsp 3.0.1 does not reproduce (`func_0880B420`,
`func_0880EDF8`) are in the first outer region; the six it reproduces are at
0x08822990 and above.

## Hypotheses (not proven)

- The outer regions are libraries linked before and after the game objects: the
  first holds C string functions (0x0880ED04-0x0880EE10, `notes/COMPILER.md`) and
  `.data` starts with libc strings (`"_exit"`, `"libc:%s: should be called from main
  thread\n"` at 0x0890F900 and 0x0890F908); the second holds the entry point.
- They were built by another compiler or another `mwccpsp` version. Which one is not
  known; no candidate has been probed on them yet.

## Method

Throw-away scripts over `asm/ULES01213/boot/text*.s` (one function per `glabel`);
re-run them after any change of the splat config. A tool for this belongs in
`tools/psp` once a second use appears.
